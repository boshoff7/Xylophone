SKILLS LEARNT:

 - Play sounds: Play a sound using AVFoundation module. Setting up the AVAudioPlayer and creating a function to access the sounds file location through        Bundle.main.url
 - playback: Resetting the default phone audio settings with Audio Session, to make sure that the sound plays even when then users device is on silent        mode.
 - Multiple IBActions: Linked all the sound buttons to 1 IBAction. Using the sender value to access the tapped button.
 - Function with input: Added an input requirement to the function, so that I can add the button title of the button that was tapped and input it into the    playsound() fucntion.
